                <paragraph id="about">
                    My name is Dustin. I am from Eagle Mountain, UT. I love Gaming, Coding, Trucks, Tractors<br>
                    and lots in between. I am married to my Best Friend for just over 3 years. I am learning<br>
                    to code and loving this new career path. I love to livestream games on Twitch.tv from time<br>
                    to time. I have a CDL Class A, Life Insurance license, can Weld, paint and fix just about <br>
                    anything. Love to work hard and hope to one day live in a small town.

            <h3>Story Time</h3>
            <paragraph id="story">
                My project that I had a bunch of fun with is my Trucks Giveaway website.<br>
                I had a blast coding this, and I coded it using HTML/CSS and Javascript.<br>
                I enjoy HTML/CSS very much, even though its a little frustrating. Javascript<br>
                is great for adding functionality and being able to keep it simple.<br>
                The functionality of Javascript is simple yet very functional and smooth.<br>
                My next project I am working on is a "Small Streamers" community site that I<br>
                am building for small content creators to easily access and find smaller content<br>
                creators where they would normally be buried in a directory.
